# Vizhi for Codex

**Physical hardware controls for [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) on the Logitech MX Creative Keypad.**

> Press a button. Ship code.

Vizhi for Codex turns the keypad's nine LCD keys into a control surface for Codex CLI: live
session status, one-press prompts and git actions, approval keys that grade the risk of what
they're approving, native `/review`, screenshots that land in the running conversation, and
fully offline voice dictation. No cloud, no API keys — everything runs on your machine.

Built on the same engine as [Claude Console](../../../README.md): one core, one adapter per
agent, one package per product. *(Not an OpenAI product; Codex is a trademark of OpenAI.)*

> Vizhi for Codex and Claude Console can be installed side by side: since 1.6.0 / 2.2.0 neither
> binds an application, so the Logi Plugin Service has nothing to arbitrate — put each product's
> keys on whatever profile you like. (Earlier versions both claimed Terminal.app and only one won.)

## Status

**Preview.** Verified on real hardware on macOS (Apple Silicon): session discovery, the hook
state bridge, live busy/waiting/ready, focus tracking and tab switching, risk-graded approvals,
model and context display, voice, screenshot, and every prompt/git/navigation key.

**Windows (1.6.0): official hooks plus a recovery fallback.** Current Codex supports Windows
command hooks through `commandWindows`, including the exact `PermissionRequest` event used for
risk-graded approval lighting. Vizhi installs those hooks and keeps the rollout reader as a
fallback while hooks await trust, for older clients, and for interrupted-turn recovery. Windows
tab-switching selects the intended session by console identity, including when two tabs have the
same title.

## The layout

| Page | Keys |
|---|---|
| 1 — Sessions & interaction | Codex sessions ×3 · Esc · No · Yes · **Screenshot** · **Dictate** · **Draft** |
| 2 — Codex controls | Model · Plan · Skills · Review · **Context gauge** · Compact · Up · Enter · Down |
| 3 — Prompts | Explore · Explain · Document · Optimize · Refactor · Fix Bug · Code Audit · Write Tests · Security |
| 4 — Terminal | Voice "Go to Project" · New Tab · New Codex · Prev/Next Tab · Exit · Agent · Fork · Resume |
| 5 — Git | Git Status · Diff · Log · Commit · Push · Create PR |

With multiple Codex sessions open, press a session key before Yes/No. Until a session is selected,
both answer keys show **Select session** without an approval badge. Once selected, the highlighted
session pill identifies the target; the answer keys show **Yes** and **No**. A pending request in
another session cannot redirect either key.
If the selected session closes or you release its pin, select again before answering. A fresh
single-session workflow still works without this extra selection. The keypad is limited to three
session keys on page 1. Additional sessions can remain open in the terminal, but their pending
requests cannot light or receive answers from the keypad, including a saved selection outside
the three visible slots.

Highlights that are Codex-specific:

- **Screenshot → current conversation.** Press, drag a region (the system's own ⇧⌘4 picker),
  and the path is typed into your running session with an instruction Codex's model follows to
  open the image. Add your question, press Return.
  *Known issue:* while the picker is open the keypad switches to its default profile, so Vizhi's
  Escape key is not on screen. Press Escape on the keyboard to dismiss the picker; the Vizhi
  profile comes back on its own.
- **Native `/review`.** One press opens Codex's review picker — uncommitted changes, against a
  base branch, or a commit. (Page 3's Code Audit is different on purpose: it types a structured
  review *prompt* into the current conversation.)
- **Codex power controls.** Plan, Agent, Fork, Skills, and Resume open Codex's own TUI
  workflows. The keypad does not imitate their menus; it opens the native picker and leaves the
  menu arrows and Enter available on page 2. Plan sends the native Shift+Tab toggle rather than
  repeatedly entering /plan; a customized CLI keymap may require restoring that shortcut.
  When the Agent workflow opens `codex agents` in a separate tab, tap the pinned session again
  to release targeting, then focus that tab before using the keypad arrows.
- **Context at a glance.** The gauge shows remaining capacity, turns amber below 25% and red below
  10%. Press for Codex `/status`; hold to run `/compact`.
- **Approvals you can read from across the room.** Yes/No and the session key light amber when
  Codex wants permission — red when the pending command is destructive (`git push`, `rm -rf`,
  `sudo`…).
- **Voice, fully offline** — [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp), notarized
  helper, on-device model. **Voice** submits; **Voice Draft** types without submitting so you
  can fix a mis-hearing.

## What you won't find, and why

The keypad never shows a value the agent did not report:

- **No Cost key** — Codex bills a subscription and reports no spend; a `$0.00` would be
  indistinguishable from a free session.
- **No autocomplete Tab / generic Mode-cycle keys** — Codex has no equivalent interaction; its
  native Plan toggle has a dedicated key instead.
- **Context %** is read best-effort from Codex's session transcript, a format OpenAI documents
  as unstable — when it surprises us the key shows nothing rather than a stale number.

## Install (macOS and Windows preview)

1. **Logi Options+ 6.4+** with the MX Creative Keypad set up.
2. Double-click `VizhiCodex_<version>.lplug4` → Options+ asks to install.
3. **Import the layout.** The plugin is universal — no application binding, no layout of its
   own — so nothing appears until you give it keys. From the release, import
   `VizhiCodex-Terminal.lp5` on macOS or `VizhiCodex-WindowsTerminal.lp5` on Windows: Options+ → keypad →
   profile menu → **Import Profile**. It lands on Terminal or Windows Terminal with the Codex keys
   populated. Or add the terminal yourself and drag the **Vizhi for Codex** actions on by hand.
4. **Trust the hooks.** Your next Codex session opens with **"Hooks need review — 7 hooks are
   new or changed"**. All seven are this plugin: one per lifecycle event, each running the same
   one-line launcher (`~/.codex/codex-console/scripts/codex-hook.sh`), which writes state files
   for the keypad and nothing else. Review and trust; Codex trusts by hash, so it's one-time.
   Until trusted, keys show static labels and no live state — `/hooks` reopens the review if
   you skipped it. (Never use `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` — it disables the review for
   everything, not just this plugin.)
   On Windows the reviewed command uses Codex's `commandWindows` override: a small PowerShell
   launcher that runs the packaged `claude-console-hook.exe` and records when it cannot (missing,
   blocked or crashing), which is what puts **Blocked** on the keys instead of silence. Rollout
   polling remains available as a fallback. Updating from 1.6.1 changes that command once, so
   Codex asks you to trust the seven hooks again; the keys read **Run /hooks** until you do.
5. **Grant permissions as the OS asks.** On macOS:
   - **Accessibility** (Logi Plugin Service) — how keys type into Terminal.
   - **Microphone** (first Voice press).
   - **Screen Recording** (first Screenshot press).
   On Windows, allow microphone access for desktop apps when using voice; text injection and
   screenshots need no additional permission prompt.

## Updating profiles and prompts

For an existing customized keypad, follow [the export, backup and explicit update workflow](../../../docs/profile-updates.md).
A plugin upgrade does not rearrange an imported profile. Vizhi prompt settings now live at
`~/.codex/vizhi/prompts.json`; the first load copies a valid Claude prompt list if present, then
future edits are independent. An existing Vizhi file always wins. Invalid migration sources
stay untouched and are retried on reload after correction.

## Building from source

  bash tools/voice/pack-release.sh <ver> VizhiCodex      # pack the .lplug4
```

See the repo root's [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) and
[docs/multi-agent-architecture.md](../../../docs/multi-agent-architecture.md) for the
architecture — the platform seam, the agent seam, and why each product ships separately.

## Compatibility notes for the acceptance fixes

On macOS, provisional session keys use the live Codex process directory before the first hook.
They say **Ready**, not Complete. After a conversation ends during Fork/Resume, old context and
session identity are cleared until a new hook arrives; the project remains visible.

Vizhi installs executable speech components under `~/.codex/vizhi-runtime/`; Claude Console keeps
its existing runtime location. The large model remains shared under
`~/.claude/claude-console/whisper/`. Alternating products cannot replace each other's helper.
First microphone permission at the new helper location still requires device verification.

Project discovery remains shared. A nonempty `~/.claude/claude-console/project-roots` overrides
automatic search; clear its entries to restore automatic discovery, or add project parent folders.
No personal project path is built into the plugin. No-match feedback now remains on the key for
8 seconds. Prompt configuration also remains shared; Code Audit is a Vizhi display label and no
longer rewrites Claude's Review label in an unedited configuration file.
