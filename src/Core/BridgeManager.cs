        // The live keys (Cost / Context / Model, Activity) read /tmp state files that only get
        // written when Claude Code is wired to push them: a `statusLine` handler feeds Cost/Context/
        // Model and five `hooks` feed Activity, all via ~/.claude/settings.json. The plugin ships the
        // two scripts embedded in the DLL and writes them to ~/.claude/claude-console/scripts/ on
        // every load — that touches nothing of the user's. The settings.json edit is a different
        // matter: it is the user's file, so it happens only when they invoke Enable Live Status
        // (a key, or its button in Options+), whose description says what will change. Until then
        // the live keys read "Set up" and a press on one changes nothing.
        //
        // It used to wire on first load, with a notice afterwards. Logitech QA's retest called that
        // what it was — a modification of user config without a prompt — and the SDK offers no
        // dialog and no settings page to ask through (the spike is in docs/HANDOFF-qa-fixes.md).
        // So the press is the prompt.
        //
        // Safe by design either way: MERGES rather than clobbers (appends a hook only if absent;
        // CHAINS an existing statusLine instead of replacing it — see the chain block in
        // statusline-handler.sh), writes only over the bytes it read (RewriteSettings), takes a
        // rolling backup before every write, and is idempotent. Disable takes exactly our entries
        // back out and leaves the marker file ~/.claude/claude-console/no-autowire behind, which is
        // how the keys know to say "Off" rather than "Set up". A marker created by hand while the
        // wiring is present still unwires on the next load (the 2.2.0 two-way switch), for one release.
