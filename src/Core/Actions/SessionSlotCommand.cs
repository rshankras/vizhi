    ///
    /// Each key shows the session's project name, its context usage, and a face for what it's doing
    /// (working / waiting on you / ready). Pressing one focuses that Terminal tab AND pins every
    /// other key to it, so you can answer a prompt in session 2 while looking at session 1 — or at
    /// a browser. The pin holds until you press another session key or that session exits; it is
    /// deliberately NOT undone by switching Terminal tabs (see BridgeManager.RoutingTty); pressing the
    /// pinned slot AGAIN releases it. Slots are
    /// stable: when a session exits, the others keep their keys.
    ///
    /// Six slots fill one 9-key page alongside Yes / No / Voice. Empty slots draw a blank face and
    /// do nothing on press.
    ///
    /// Face layout (2026-08-30 design): the project (directory) name is centred in the black title
    /// region, with the live state in a bar along the bottom. The active/routed session uses its
    /// product identity colour (Claude orange or Codex blue); inactive sessions use grey. The word
    /// in the bar says what that session is doing (Thinking / Allow? / Waiting / Complete),
    /// independently of the bar colour.
