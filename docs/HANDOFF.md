# Handoff — Windows port, as of 2026-08-08

> **Note:** this document covers the 2.0.0 Windows port. The multi-agent work (one repo,
> a package per agent) is on `feat/multi-agent` — see
> [HANDOFF-multi-agent.md](HANDOFF-multi-agent.md).

**2.0.0 SHIPPED 2026-08-08**: clean-install gate passed on a fresh account (item 2),
`feat/windows-port-phase0` merged to `main`, tagged `v2.0.0`, released on GitHub.
Suite: **396 C# + 20 bash, green** — `bash tests/run-all.sh`.

Design doc: `docs/windows-port-2.0-plan.md`. Windows-machine notes:
`docs/windows-debug-handoff.md`.

## What is done

**The Windows port is functionally complete and verified on real hardware.** All seven phases
landed: platform seam, session discovery, console injection, terminal control, hooks/IPC, voice,
packaging. On the Windows laptop, **voice and Tab both fire from the keypad** — voice being the
longest chain in the product (record → transcribe → resolve target session → spawn helper →
attach to console → type), so everything under it is proven.

Architecture in one line: everything OS-specific sits behind `IPlatformBridge`
(`src/Platform/`), `BridgeManager` keeps the platform-neutral half, and the action classes name
intents (`InjectKey(KeyStroke.ArrowUp)`) rather than passing AppleScript through. macOS behaviour
is unchanged throughout.

Windows ships four helper executables in the package: `claude-console-inject` (types into a
session's console), `-hook` (statusline + activity), `-focus` (selects the Windows Terminal tab),
`-voice` (mic + whisper).

## Outstanding, in order

### 1. ~~The packaged profile ships the wrong top row~~ FIXED 2026-08-08
Turned out to be preview-only: the packaged `.lp5`'s **`ProfileInfo.json` (the layout that
actually imports) already had Session 1/2/3** on the top row — only `metadata/ProfilePreview.json`
(the Options+ thumbnail strip) still showed Context / Working / Mode. The three preview entries
were copied verbatim from the hand-edited installed profile (displayName, actionName,
description, image) into `src/package/profiles/DefaultProfile70.lp5`, and
`profiles/ClaudeConsole-Windows.lp5` was regenerated from it via
`tools/windows/make-windows-profile.sh`. Both verified: preview and layout top rows agree
(SessionSlotCommand 1/2/3), bindings and GUIDs unchanged (`com.apple.Terminal`/…0B58,
`WindowsTerminal`/…0B59).

~~Still open from this item: confirm on the hardware that the installed profile renders live
session keys on the top row.~~ **Confirmed 2026-08-08**: Options+ device view shows slot 1
live-painting a real session (context %, project name) with slots 2/3 idle — SessionSlotCommand
repaints as designed.

Related, ~~still open~~ **fixed 2026-08-08**: with the Claude Console profile selected, the
Options+ actions sidebar defaulted to System Actions instead of the plugin's actions. Cause: the
profile's `ProfileInfo.json` had `nativePluginName: null` / `hasNativePlugin: false`
(ClaudeConsole only in `additionalNativePluginNames`) — an artifact of the profile's origin as a
com.apple.terminal export; working plugins (Vizhi, Figma) stamp their own plugin as the
profile's native plugin. Stamped `nativePluginName: ClaudeConsole` / `hasNativePlugin: true`
(ClaudeConsole removed from additional) in the packaged profile, the installed profile
(pre-edit backup: `~/Desktop/ProfileInfo-before-nativeplugin.json`), and the regenerated
Windows profile; `ClaudeConsole_1.8.8.lplug4` repacked with the fix.

### 2. Clean-install verification — the real release gate. **PASSED 2026-08-08** (fresh
### `testuser3`, full logout, hands off: icon + layout appeared on their own in 30–40 s)
History of the three rounds, kept for the record:
The gate ran properly (full logout into a fresh `testuser` account, no fast switching, reboots
between sessions) against the 2.0.0 artifact: **no icon, no layout.** Evidence pulled from the
test account settled the mechanism — see the re-corrected root-cause model below. In short: a
sideloaded `.lplug4` install **never** creates the application registration, on any platform;
only Marketplace installs do. Every machine that ever "worked" was coasting on an entry created
by dev-era service activity (`@_claudeconsole` born 2026-08-06 18:53 during phase-0 dev — which
is also what the old "1.7.1 demonstrably did this" claim actually was; `@_vizhi` born Jul 18,
a month before Vizhi's first package install). A 90-second observation with the entry moved
aside confirmed nothing recreates it: not service restart, not plugin load, not activating
Terminal, not opening Options+.

**The fix — `src/Platform/SelfRegistration.cs` (in the rebuilt 2.0.0):** at load, when no
`@_claudeconsole` exists under any device type, the plugin writes the registration itself —
the packaged `DefaultProfile70.lp5` already carries the complete document (its
`ApplicationInfo.json`, `defaultProfileName` matching its inner profile) — icon from the
payload, profile extracted to `Profiles/<GUID>/`, then one service restart via the
RegistrationHeal machinery. Windows patches `processOrBundleName` to `WindowsTerminal`. The
layout is exactly what the validated Windows manual recovery wrote by hand. Loop-proof
structurally (the trigger is "dir missing"; the pass creates it). 7 tests in
`tests/SelfRegistrationTests.cs`. This also makes Windows post-uninstall reinstalls rebuild
the default layout unaided.

**Re-test procedure:** full logout → `testuser` → install the rebuilt
`/Users/Shared/ClaudeConsole_2.0.0.lplug4` → Options+ blinks and comes back within ~40 s
(the self-registration restart; first run of round two showed the files land and the service
adopt them, but the 6 s warm-restart settle reopened the window before a FIRST-RUN service
finished initializing — stale list, icon only after a manual relaunch; settle now 20 s) →
PASS = Claude Console icon in the strip, 9-key layout with Session 1/2/3, sidebar opens on
Claude Console actions, zero manual steps.

### 3. ~~CHANGELOG is stale~~ DONE 2026-08-08
1.8.6/1.8.7 folded into one honest zero-net entry (payload split + revert), and 1.8.8 added
(session-keys preview fix + native-plugin stamp). README's Windows section was already complete
and accurate.

### 4. Merge to main and release
Only after 1–3. `.lplug4` files are gitignored; releases go to GitHub Releases.

### ~~Post-release candidate: auto-heal the reinstall registration desync~~ SHIPPED in 1.8.9
`src/Platform/RegistrationHeal.cs`, wired at the end of `ClaudeConsolePlugin.Load`, exactly per
the three-signal design (install-event load + registration older than payload + one-shot
marker; the cold-start gate alone makes a loop impossible). Seven unit tests in
`tests/RegistrationHealTests.cs`. macOS only — Windows reinstall behaviour unverified.
Refined through field testing to 1.8.11: the gate is payload-newer-than-service-start (so
back-to-back reinstalls each heal), a 10 s settle delay before the restart, and an explicit
reopen of the Options+ window (launchd respawns the agent windowless).

**Windows: a DIFFERENT failure with the same symptom (settled 2026-08-08 on the laptop).**
The heal was ported in 1.8.13 (plain-process restart via a .cmd — `LogiPluginService.exe` is
NOT an SCM service and nothing respawns it after a kill), but it correctly never fires there,
because Windows' uninstall **deletes the application data outright** — after a reinstall the
machine had only `@_defaultwin`: no `@_claudeconsole`, no Windows Terminal entry, no Claude
Console profile anywhere. Nothing on disk to re-adopt, so no restart can help. Same as macOS,
a reinstall of a known package never re-runs registration. **Windows recovery = re-import
`profiles/ClaudeConsole-Windows.lp5`** (one step: recreates the application entry + layout),
which is already the documented Windows install path. Plugin log:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Logi\LogiPluginService\Logs\plugin_logs\ClaudeConsole.log`.
Trap found during recovery: **importing the .lp5 while no Claude Console application is
registered makes Options+ bind the profile to an application it invents from context** (it
landed under `powershell_ise`). Recovery, validated end-to-end on 2026-08-08: stop the
service, write `@_claudeconsole/ApplicationInfo.json` by hand (Mac/Vizhi schema;
`processOrBundleName: WindowsTerminal`, `nativePluginName: ClaudeConsole`), move the imported
profile instance under it, rebind its `applicationName`, delete the bogus app dir, restart
the service — it adopts the entry from the disk scan. Working icon + live keys confirmed.

~~Possible future work: Windows self-registration~~ **SHIPPED for BOTH platforms in the
rebuilt 2.0.0** (`SelfRegistration.cs`, item 2): when no application data exists, the plugin
writes the registration files itself and restarts the service to adopt them.

**Root-cause model, re-corrected 2026-08-08 (evening — supersedes the morning version):** a
reinstall of an already-known package is a pure payload swap — the service consults NOTHING in
the package (`@_claudeconsole` timestamps stay untouched through every reinstall). The morning
version's remaining error: "a first-ever install runs registration+import" is FALSE for
sideloaded packages — **no sideloaded install ever runs it; only Marketplace installs do**
(marketplace plugins' `@_` dirs are born in the same minute as their payload; ClaudeConsole's
and Vizhi's were born during dev-era service activity, weeks before their first package
installs). Also settled: the `already loaded` ERROR pair in the plugin log at service start is
universal boot noise for every sideloaded plugin (the service loads each twice — internal
record, then folder scan; the second logs the refusal) — it does not indicate a failed load
unless a dev `.link` is in play. No package shape can fix any of this; the plugin owns its
registration now: SelfRegistration creates it, RegistrationHeal re-adopts it.

## Build, test, release

```bash
# tests (both suites)
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/dotnet/10.0.302/bin:$PATH
export DOTNET_ROOT=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/dotnet/10.0.302/libexec
bash tests/run-all.sh

# compile-check WITHOUT touching the live Logi install
dotnet build src/ClaudeConsolePlugin.csproj -t:Compile -p:SkipPluginLink=true

# full release build (plugin + Windows helpers + notarized voice payload)
bash tools/voice/pack-release.sh <version>

# pack — needs the .NET 8 runtime; logiplugintool DIES under .NET 10
export DOTNET_ROOT=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/dotnet@8/8.0.124/libexec
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/dotnet@8/8.0.124/bin:$PATH
logiplugintool pack ./bin/Release ./ClaudeConsole_<v>.lplug4
```

**The default `dotnet` on this machine is now 10.0.302**, so the pack step needs the explicit
.NET 8 override shown above — it used to work in the bare default environment and no longer does.

Package is ~26 MB. Most of that is three self-contained, trimmed Windows helpers at ~12 MB each.
**Do not "fix" this by making them framework-dependent**: LogiPluginService carries its own
*private* .NET runtime, so a machine running Options+ may have no machine-wide .NET, and typing
would silently die there. NativeAOT would cut it to ~3 MB each but needs the MSVC toolchain.

---

## Traps that cost real time

- **Any reinstall makes the app icon vanish from Options+ — nothing is broken on disk.** This
  includes installing straight over an existing installation with no explicit uninstall
  (confirmed 2026-08-08): the install runs an uninstall step internally. That step drops
  `@_claudeconsole` from the service's in-memory application list but keeps the directory
  (profiles survive); the install step sees the directory and silently skips re-registration. The plugin still loads; only the registration is gone from the live list.
  Recovery (proven 2026-08-08): `killall LogiPluginService` — it rebuilds the list from disk at
  startup — then `killall logioptionsplus_agent` so the UI reconnects. Restarting only Options+
  does nothing. Corollary: a reinstall on a machine with prior registration proves nothing about
  install-time registration — only a clean account exercises that path.
- **Never `rm` an `@_<app>` directory under `Applications/Loupedeck70/`.** It desyncs the service
  so that subsequent installs *silently* skip registration and profile import — including
  known-good packages. This was already in the notes; doing it anyway burned an evening and made
  three different versions appear broken when none were.
- **Registration happens at INSTALL time, not load time.** Editing an installed package's metadata
  cannot re-trigger it. Only a fresh install of a corrected package proves anything.
- **Options+ lags the filesystem.** Profile data can be complete and correct on disk while the UI
  shows nothing. Trust the disk; a restart or a manual import eventually refreshes the UI.
- **To check whether the plugin is actually live**, look at `/tmp/claude-console/registry.json` —
  only the plugin writes it. `"already loaded"` in the plugin log is often a benign duplicate
  load attempt, not a failure.
- **A dev `.link` and an installed `.lplug4` collide.** `pack-release.sh` now passes
  `SkipPluginLink=true` and clears stale links, but a bare `dotnet build` still writes one.
- **`system_profiler` returns empty output in the agent sandbox** regardless of what is connected.
  Use `ioreg` to check for hardware. A wrong "the keypad isn't plugged in" claim came from this.
- **Test fixtures that supply data the real code path fetches itself prove nothing.** Two Windows
  bugs shipped green because fixtures handed `SessionsFrom` a populated command line while the
  real enumerator returns null and resolves separately. Drive `WindowsPlatformBridge`, not the
  pure helpers.

---

## Machine state (this Mac)

- **Logi launch agents were unloaded** during debugging (`com.logi.optionsplus`,
  `com.logi.cp-dev-mgr`) and `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.logi.optionsplus.plist` is gone. Options+
  may not auto-start at login; launching it manually should re-register it.
- **Backups on the Desktop**: `claude-console-profile-backup-20260807-211135/` (the full
  `@_claudeconsole` registration as it was before any of this) and
  `ProfilePreview-before-sessions.json` (the installed profile before the session-keys edit).
- The installed profile's top row was **hand-edited** to Session 1/2/3 and is not what the package
  ships — see item 1.

## Standing context

The 2026-08-07 injection spike (`spikes/windows-injection/`, untracked) is what retired the
go/no-go: writes go to a **console handle**, not the foreground window, so on Windows a keypress
reaches the intended session or nothing at all — it cannot leak into another application even in
principle. That is a stronger guarantee than the macOS AppleScript path provides.

The one genuine platform gap: Windows Terminal exposes no supported way to ask which tab is in
front, so with several idle sessions the plugin cannot tell which you are looking at. One session
works with no pin; beyond that, press a session key first. Pinning is exact. This is documented in
the README's Windows notes.

## Future: other terminals (assessed 2026-08-08)

**iTerm2 — shipped 2026-10-14 (#128)**, as the seam described here: `MacTerminalDriver` with
Terminal.app and iTerm2 drivers inside the Mac bridge, the owner recorded per session so a mixed
setup routes per press, no-session gestures following the terminal in front or last touched, and
`tools/make-iterm2-profiles.py` deriving the iTerm2 layouts. The assessment as written on
2026-08-08 follows.

**iTerm2 is the one worth doing**: its AppleScript dictionary
addresses sessions by `tty` and types via `write text`, so the exact-targeting guarantee ("a
keystroke reaches the intended session or nothing") carries over intact. Shape: a terminal seam
inside the Mac bridge (the same move IPlatformBridge made for the OS — the action layer already
speaks intents; only the seven Terminal.app AppleScript blocks in MacPlatformBridge are
terminal-specific), plus an iTerm-bound application/profile entry, same pattern as the Windows
.lp5. Everything TTY-keyed (sessions, statusline, hooks, voice, registry) already works in any
terminal unchanged.

**Ghostty / Warp / Alacritty / Kitty: no, until they grow scriptable per-tab addressing.** The
only way in would be blind keystrokes into the frontmost window — the exact unsafety this plugin
refuses (and the README already promises it won't type into them).
