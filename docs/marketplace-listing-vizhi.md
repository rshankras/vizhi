# Marketplace Listing Copy — Vizhi for Codex

Draft text for the Logitech Marketplace submission form
([marketplace.logitech.com/contribute](https://marketplace.logitech.com/contribute)) for **Vizhi
for Codex 1.6.2** (1.6.1 was the first submission, 2026-09-16). Same structure and field limits as Claude Console's
[marketplace-listing.md](marketplace-listing.md); process and packaging live in
[SUBMISSION.md](../SUBMISSION.md).

Character counts below are `wc -m` with a UTF-8 locale, verified against the drafts in this file.
Read that file's **Lessons for next time** before pasting into the form — especially: never paste
from a terminal window (invisible indent counts against the limit), use `pbcopy`.

## 1.7.0 submission pack (prepared 2026-10-29)

Paste these into the form. Counts are Python `len()` on the exact text; never paste from a terminal window.

**Package:** `VizhiCodex_1.7.0.lplug4` (repo root, built from main `bf2edb9`), SHA-256
`f3149199928c83c96c043c8ef2607e143b0ad678b8eddefd8f852e4ecb8ce781`, also attached to GitHub release
[vizhi-codex/v1.7.0](https://github.com/rshankras/vizhi/releases/tag/vizhi-codex/v1.7.0). The yaml inside says
`displayName: Vizhi for Codex`, `version: 1.7.0`, support https://vizhi.dev/faq/, homepage https://vizhi.dev/vizhi-codex/.

### Release notes — 860 characters (limit 1000, 140 spare)

```markdown
iTerm2 support, and layouts named after the terminal they bind to.

- **iTerm2 is supported** on macOS alongside Apple Terminal. Codex sessions in iTerm2 get their own keys, and every key reaches them; run Terminal and iTerm2 together and each key goes to the right one. Import the iTerm2 layout from vizhi.dev/layouts.
- **The highlighted session bar follows the tab in front**, and a selected key wears a frame, so a selection and the tab in front never look the same.
- **Layout files are named after the terminal they are for**: VizhiCodex-Terminal, VizhiCodex-iTerm2, VizhiCodex-WindowsTerminal. Same keys, so no re-import is needed; if you import a new file, delete the old profile afterwards.
- **Windows:** every file is re-signed, and the signed hook launcher is rebuilt, so Codex asks once more to trust the hooks. The hooks themselves are unchanged.
```

### Notes to the reviewer (free text / the mail)

```
Vizhi for Codex 1.7.0. What changed: iTerm2 support on macOS alongside Apple Terminal (same engine change as Vizhi for Claude Code 2.4.0); the highlighted session bar follows the tab in front and a selected key wears a frame; the keypad layouts are named after the terminal they bind to (download from vizhi.dev/layouts).

Suggested test focus on macOS: run codex in iTerm2 and in Terminal at the same time; trust the hooks once; press each session key; answer an approval with Yes and No; Dictate into the iTerm2 session; New Tab and New Codex while iTerm2 is in front. Importing a layout next to an older one adds a second profile in Options+; delete the old one afterwards.

Windows: no behaviour change in the terminal driver; every file is re-signed (Certum, publisher Ravi Shankar S). The signed hook launcher is rebuilt, so Codex asks once more to trust the seven Vizhi hooks after the update; the hooks themselves are unchanged.

Known and already fixed for the next update: a silent microphone input is transcribed as "you", and voice failure faces are hard to see on the key.
```

### Before you click submit

- [ ] Windows smoke on the laptop: install over 1.6.2, trust the hooks when Codex asks, a session key, Yes, Dictate.
- [x] macOS device pass on the packaged build (docs/release-2.4.0.md): iTerm2 and Terminal sessions, two approvals by key.
- [x] GitHub release vizhi-codex/v1.7.0 published; vizhi.dev deployed.
- [x] Package verifier passed; notarization accepted; 16 of 16 Windows files signed.
- [ ] The carried-over teaser and description in the portal replaced with the text above.

## Auto-filled fields (from `LoupedeckPackage.yaml`)

Read out of the uploaded `.lplug4`; the form fills them itself. To change any, edit
`src/Products/VizhiCodex/package/metadata/LoupedeckPackage.yaml` and repack.

| Field | Value |

> All user-facing links point at vizhi.dev as of 2026-09-09: the source repository is meant to be

> **Caveat as of 2026-09-16:** `claude-console` is still public, and the 1.6.1 package is published

> #68/#71, when every card button broke for a week. The Marketplace is the real distribution channel
> and the layouts are already served from vizhi.dev, so the exposure is the release link alone.
> Decide before closing the repo whether the package also needs a home on vizhi.dev.

### 1.6.2 — 2026-09-28

An update, so written as what changed. No version heading — the page shows the version from the
package. The portal's markdown has no inline code, so filenames and commands are bold or bare.
**972 characters** (28 spare):

```markdown
Signed Windows payload, and fixes from the 1.6.1 review.

- **Every Windows file is code-signed** (Certum, publisher Ravi Shankar S), so security software can allow the publisher once instead of quarantining the hook helper.
- **Blocked instead of silence** — if security software removes or blocks the hook helper, the keys read Blocked and Options+ names the file. Recovers on the next hook.
- **Approvals stay on their own session** — with Codex 0.158's shared daemon, one session's approval could light another session's key; events now return to the terminal that owns them.
- **Yes/No work right after install** on a PC whose clock sits behind the packing machine's time zone.
- **Session keys no longer report "action failed"** for a switch that worked; the key reads Selecting meanwhile.
- **New Tab and New Codex open in your project folder**, never the user profile root.

After updating on Windows, Codex asks you to trust the Vizhi hooks once more: run /hooks.
```

### 1.6.1 — as submitted 2026-09-16

First Marketplace release for this product, so written as an introduction rather than a
changelog. No version heading — the page shows the version from the package. **986 characters**
(14 spare). The approval line carried a `(macOS)` qualifier until 1.6.1; Codex's Windows hook now
writes the same envelope, and risk classification has never been OS-gated, so the keys light on
both platforms:

```markdown
First Marketplace release. Vizhi for Codex makes the MX Creative Keypad a control surface for OpenAI Codex CLI on macOS and Windows.

- **A key per session** — run up to 3 Codex sessions, each key showing its project, state & context; press one to focus it
- **Answer Codex** — Yes/No and menu navigation; approval keys light amber or red when Codex reports risk
- **One-press prompts** — Fix Bug, Write Tests, Review & more, customizable
- **Screenshot** — capture a screen region into the running conversation
- **Native Codex controls** — Plan, Agent, Fork, Skills, Status, Resume and Review
- **Git** — commit, diff, push and PR
- **Offline voice** — dictate a prompt or jump to a project by speaking its name; local transcription, no cloud
- **Safer targeting** — stable session pins and identity-based Terminal tab switching

Setup: install, then import `VizhiCodex-Keypad.lp5` on macOS or `VizhiCodex-Windows.lp5` on Windows. The universal plugin can coexist with Claude Console.
```

## Notes for the reviewer / support answers

Things a QA reviewer is likely to hit, with the honest answer ready:

- **Two plugins can coexist.** Vizhi and Claude Console are universal plugins and claim no
  application. Their downloadable layouts use distinct identities and can both be imported.
- **The keys need Codex running in a terminal.** No sessions, no live keys — by design, and the
  keypad says so rather than inventing state.
- **macOS asks for permissions**, once each: Accessibility (typing into Terminal), Microphone
  (voice), Screen Recording (screenshot).
- **Codex asks you to trust the plugin's hooks on both platforms** — run `/hooks` and approve.
  That is Codex's own security model; the plugin can't and shouldn't bypass it.
- **Windows uses official hooks plus rollout fallback.** `commandWindows` carries exact lifecycle
  and approval state; Codex's session transcript keeps basic state alive if a hook is missed.
- **With more than one session running, Yes/No refuse until a session key is pressed.** That is
  deliberate, not a broken key: the keypad will not guess which session an approval belongs to,
  because answering the wrong one runs or cancels the wrong command. The keys beep and a card
  explains it once. Press a session key first, then Yes or No. With a single session and no
  selection ever made, the keys answer it directly.
- **The screenshot picker switches the keypad to its default profile** while the overlay is open,
  so Vizhi's Escape key is off screen. Press Escape on the keyboard: the picker closes and the
  Vizhi profile returns by itself. Known issue, accepted for this release.
- **Every Windows executable and DLL is code-signed (1.6.2).** Authenticode from Certum, publisher
  *Ravi Shankar S*, SHA-256 with an RFC 3161 timestamp; the package verifier refuses an unsigned
  file. A brand-new certificate can still trip a scanner's reputation check, in which case the
  keys read **Blocked** and Options+ names the file — that is the scanner, not a broken plugin,
  and the publisher can be allow-listed once. macOS: the voice helper is Developer ID signed,
  notarized and stapled, re-verified after packing.
- **After updating to 1.6.2 on Windows, Codex asks you to trust the hooks again.** The hook
  command changed once (it now runs through the guarded launcher, #126) and Codex trusts hooks
  by hash. The keys read **Run /hooks** until you approve; nothing else needs redoing.
- **A session key reads Selecting for about a second on Windows.** Focusing a Windows Terminal
  tab takes 1.3–1.8 s, longer than the SDK's action budget, so the switch now runs off the key
  press (#112). A second session key pressed during that second is ignored, not queued.
- **Not affiliated with OpenAI.** "Codex" is OpenAI's product; the listing and README both say so.

## Before submitting — checklist

- [x] Exactly one **plugin** DLL and no `PluginApi.dll` or its host closure (what got Claude
      Console 2.0.0 rejected). A bare `grep '\.dll'` is no longer a useful check: since the Windows
      whisper runtime started shipping, the package legitimately carries twelve more under
      `bin/voice/whisper-bin-win/`. Verify the three things that actually matter:
      ```bash
      unzip -l VizhiCodex_<ver>.lplug4 | grep -c 'PluginApi.dll'                 # 0
      unzip -l VizhiCodex_<ver>.lplug4 | grep -cE ' bin/[A-Za-z]+Plugin\.dll$'   # 1
      unzip -l VizhiCodex_<ver>.lplug4 | grep -cE 'ExCSS|Svg\.|Newtonsoft|YamlDotNet'  # 0
      ```
- [x] `PRIVACY.md` and `EULA.md` cover this product and both platforms
- [x] Repo front page names this product and links to its README
- [x] Fresh-install test passed (register → import layout → keys live)
- [x] Screenshots/artwork — keypad photo at <https://vizhi.dev/assets/codex-keypad@2x.jpg>, page 1
      mid-session with a pending approval
- [x] Released and tagged: `vizhi-codex/v1.6.1`, package sha `70e6408ea216…`. Do **not** submit the
      earlier `ef35c7d765ea…` build sitting in the same folder; it predates the help-URL fix
- [ ] EULA reviewed by counsel (open item in SUBMISSION.md)
- [x] Windows helpers signed (1.6.2, #110): every `.exe` and `.dll` in the package, verified by
      `tools/verify-package.sh`; the listing no longer needs the unsigned disclosure
- [x] 1.6.2 cut a third time from main `4effebb` on 2026-09-28 (after #129, #131, #132): `VizhiCodex_1.6.2.lplug4` sha `e86d6cacc0cd…`,
      16 of 16 Windows files signed; DRAFT release `vizhi-codex/v1.6.2` awaits the Windows device pass,
      then the owner's Publish. Readiness record: [release-vizhi-1.6.2.md](release-vizhi-1.6.2.md)
