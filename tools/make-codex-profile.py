"""Build the Codex keypad profile from Claude Console's.

Both are DOWNLOADS, not package contents: the plugins are universal (#23), so neither package
carries a profile. Each .lp5 in profiles/ is a Terminal profile — bound to Options+'s own entry
for Terminal (com.apple.terminal), NOT to the plugin — with the product's actions placed on it.
The user imports it, or drags the actions on by hand; either way the binding stays Terminal's.

The layout is deliberately the same — the two products do the same job — but a copied profile is
not simply a rename. Three things have to change or the keypad lies to the user:

  1. Key bindings name the plugin that owns them ("<PluginShortName>___<Type>___<param>"). Left
     alone, every key points at a plugin this package does not contain and does nothing. The
     profile also LISTS the plugins it draws on (additionalNativePluginNames), and that list has
     to name this product.
  2. Identity is the GUID, not the display string, and the service dedupes by it. Sharing Claude
     Console's would collapse the two profiles into one.
  3. Keys for things Codex does not have must be DROPPED, not merely disabled in code. Gating an
     action so it never registers, while the profile still binds it, turns the key into an
     unresolvable binding — a live-looking key that cannot fire. The profile and the product have
     to agree.

# Codex frees two slots (Tab, Cost), but the first page must still be deliberate rather than merely
# inherit holes from Claude Console. Each page has one job:
#   1. sessions and interaction, with Esc / No / Yes matching the physical approval convention
#   2. Codex-native controls, grouped as configuration / conversation / inspection
#   3. reusable prompts, grouped as understand / change / verify
#   4. terminal creation and navigation, with menu arrows kept together
#   5. Git only — empty cells are more honest than unrelated filler controls
#
# Keyed by (page index, control id). Each entry declares what it expects to overwrite, so a change
# to Claude Console's layout upstream fails here loudly instead of silently shipping a keypad whose
# keys have quietly moved.
# The Screenshot key takes Clear's page 1 slot — it feeds the CURRENT conversation, which earns a
# front-page key the way a reset verb does not. Context is a live remaining-capacity gauge; the
# native Status, Clear and Scroll actions remain available for custom layouts without mixing their
# functions into the default Git page.
