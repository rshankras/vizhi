# Derive the Windows keypad profile from the macOS one.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: a .lp5 carries the identity of the application it belongs to, and that
# identity is OS-specific. The macOS profile says:
#
#   ApplicationInfo.json   "processOrBundleName": "com.apple.Terminal"
#   ProfileInfo.json       "applicationName":     "com.apple.terminal"
#
# On Windows the host is Windows Terminal, matched by PROCESS name, so a mac bundle id matches
# nothing and the service silently skips the import. That is the "no profile" symptom.
#
# So: same layout, same keys, same GUID-stamped action ids — only the application binding and the
# profile GUID change. A fresh profile GUID keeps the two from deduping against each other.
#
# Both files are DOWNLOADS the user imports (Options+ -> profile menu -> import). The plugin is
# universal (#23) and carries no profile; each .lp5 is a profile for the TERMINAL's own Options+
# entry that happens to use our actions, so the binding here is Windows Terminal's, not ours.
# UNVERIFIED ON WINDOWS since the universal change: the entry name ("windowsterminal") and the
# default-plugin name ("DefaultWin") follow the mac file's pattern (com.apple.terminal, DefaultMac)
# and need one import on the laptop to confirm (#47's session is the natural place).
