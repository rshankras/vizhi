# sign-windows-payload.sh — Authenticode-sign every Windows executable and DLL under a directory.
#
#   bash tools/windows/sign-windows-payload.sh <dir> [ClaudeConsole|VizhiCodex]
#
# Called by tools/voice/pack-release.sh on the staged bin/ tree, after the helpers are built and
# the Windows whisper bundle is copied in, and before logiplugintool packs. It runs on the Mac:
# the certificate lives in Certum's SimplySign cloud, and SimplySign Desktop presents it to this
# machine as a PKCS#11 token (a virtual smart card). jsign does the Authenticode work; the key
# never leaves Certum.
#
# Why sign at all (#110): Logitech QA's CrowdStrike quarantined the unsigned hook exe on sight.
# A signed file names a publisher, so their IT can allow-list us once by certificate instead of
# by hash on every release. It does NOT guarantee a brand-new certificate passes any scanner —
# that is what the signed-package device pass on their machine is for.
#
# What it signs: every *.exe and *.dll under <dir>, recursively — the two helpers, the plugin DLL,
# whisper-cli.exe and the ggml DLLs. Every PE in the package, because endpoint security judges
# DLL loads as well as process launches.
#
# Per release the only interactive step is being logged in to SimplySign Desktop (your email +
# the rotating code from the SimplySign phone app). Everything else is here.
#
# Environment:
#   WINDOWS_SIGNING=skip        leave the files unsigned (dev packs only; pack-release then names
#                               the package *-unsigned.lplug4 and verify-package only warns)
#   CODESIGN_PKCS11_MODULE      SimplySign's PKCS#11 library (default: the SimplySign Desktop install)
#   CODESIGN_PKCS11_SLOT        slot id for jsign's SunPKCS11 config (default 1 — "Code Signing")
#   CODESIGN_ALIAS              certificate label on the token; needed only if it holds several
#   CODESIGN_INTERMEDIATE       PEM of the issuing CA (default: tools/windows/signing/…)
#   CODESIGN_TSA                RFC 3161 timestamp server (default: Certum's)
#   CODESIGN_CAFILE             CA bundle for the post-sign verify (default: Homebrew's, then /etc/ssl)
